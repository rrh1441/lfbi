- ✅ **Added CISA-KEV data** from official CISA feed for known exploited vulnerabilities
- ✅ **Implemented p-limit** for enhanced concurrency control (MAX_CONCURRENCY = 6)
- ✅ **Added circuit breaker** - stops after 20 Wappalyzer timeouts and emits scan_warning
- ✅ **Puppeteer third-party discovery** - collects sub-resource origins with eTLD+1 deduplication
- ✅ **Enhanced version confidence** - dynamic accuracy calculation with 60% threshold
- ✅ **Supply-chain risk scoring** - 0.4*CVSS + 0.4*(EPSS*10) + 0.2*(KEV?10:0) formula
- ✅ **CycloneDX 1.5 SBOM generation** - custom implementation with vulnerability data
- ✅ **Intelligent caching layer** - 24h TTL with hit-rate tracking across all APIs
- ✅ **GitHub GraphQL optimization** - batched queries with rate limiting
- ✅ **Package intelligence** - deps.dev API for metadata, license analysis, OpenSSF scores
- ✅ **Enhanced error handling** - proper null safety and clean VulnRecord interface

- ✅ Environment variable configuration for API keys
- ✅ Fallback behaviors for missing configurations

## 🔧 Enhanced CVE Verification System ✅ COMPLETED

### CVE Verification Module ✅ COMPLETED
**File**: `cveVerifier.ts`
**Purpose**: Automated CVE applicability testing to reduce false positives
**Status**: ✅ Implemented and integrated into nuclei.ts
**Priority**: High

**Implementation Highlights**:
- ✅ **Two-layer verification system** as specified in claudefix.md
- ✅ **Distribution-level version mapping** - Ubuntu/RHEL fix data integration
- ✅ **Active exploit probes** via Nuclei template integration  
- ✅ **Banner-based CVE detection** for Apache/Nginx services
- ✅ **Intelligent caching** - 24h TTL for vendor fix data and template paths
- ✅ **Enhanced service detection** - Apache, Nginx, IIS version extraction
- ✅ **Semver comparison** - proper version comparison with distribution packages
- ✅ **Graceful degradation** - falls back to regular scan on verification failure

**Integration with nuclei.ts**:
- ✅ **CVE pre-filtering** before Phase 1 tag scans
- ✅ **HEAD request banner collection** - lightweight server detection
- ✅ **Suppression of false positives** - eliminates back-ported fixes
- ✅ **Verified exploit confirmation** - only scans exploitable CVEs
- ✅ **Performance optimization** - reduces unnecessary Nuclei template execution
- ✅ **Comprehensive logging** - detailed verification status tracking

**CVE Verification Workflow**:
1. **Banner Detection** → Extract server versions from HTTP headers
2. **CVE Mapping** → Generate relevant CVE list per service/version
3. **Version Fix Lookup** → Check Ubuntu/RHEL fix databases
4. **Exploit Verification** → Test with Nuclei templates if available
5. **Result Processing** → Suppress fixed CVEs, flag exploitable ones
6. **Enhanced Scanning** → Focus Nuclei on verified vulnerabilities only

### 🚀 Ready for Deployment

The implemented modules are production-ready and can be deployed immediately. Each module:
- Follows DealBrief's artifact/finding pipeline architecture
- Implements comprehensive safety controls
- Provides actionable security intelligence
- Includes proper error handling and logging
- **NEW**: Reduces false positives through automated CVE verification

All requested modules and enhancements have been successfully implemented according to the CLAUDE.md and claudefix.md specifications.
