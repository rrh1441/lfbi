# Typosquat Scan Analysis

## Current Situation

Based on my analysis of the codebase, there are **two separate typosquat-related modules**:

1. **`dnsTwist.ts`** - Main typosquat detection module (line 9 in worker.ts, runs as `dns_twist`)
2. **`typosquatScorer.ts`** - Separate scoring module (line 51 in worker.ts, runs as `typosquat_scorer`)

## Module Analysis

### 1. dnsTwist.ts (Primary Module)
- **Status**: Recently refactored (commit a11bd3b)
- **Execution Order**: 2nd in pipeline (after spiderfoot)
- **Artifact Type**: Creates `typo_domain` artifacts
- **Finding Type**: `PHISHING_SETUP` findings
- **Features**:
  - Uses `dnstwist` command-line tool
  - Detects wildcard DNS, MX, NS records
  - Performs phishing risk scoring
  - Checks for HTTP redirects
  - Certificate transparency log analysis
  - Batch processing with rate limiting

### 2. typosquatScorer.ts (Secondary Module)
- **Status**: Potentially problematic
- **Execution Order**: 8th in pipeline (after email_bruteforce_surface)
- **Artifact Type**: Creates `typosquat_summary` artifacts
- **Finding Type**: `ACTIVE_TYPOSQUAT` findings
- **Dependencies**:
  - Requires `WHOISXML_API_KEY` environment variable
  - Uses WhoisXML API for domain analysis
  - Requires `dnstwist` command-line tool

## Potential Issues

### 1. Duplicate Functionality
Both modules use `dnstwist` but for different purposes:
- `dnsTwist.ts`: Comprehensive threat detection
- `typosquatScorer.ts`: Focused on recently registered domains

### 2. API Dependencies
`typosquatScorer.ts` depends on WhoisXML API:
- Requires paid API key
- Has rate limiting (1 second delays)
- May fail if API key is missing/invalid
- Limited to 100 domains per scan

### 3. Execution Order Issue
`typosquatScorer.ts` runs after `dnsTwist.ts`, but both use the same `dnstwist` tool. This could lead to:
- Redundant `dnstwist` execution
- Inconsistent results
- Wasted API calls

### 4. Compilation Status
`typosquatScorer.ts` is **not compiled** in the dist directory, suggesting it may not be working:
- Present in `/apps/workers/modules/typosquatScorer.ts`
- Missing from `/dist/workers/modules/`
- Could indicate TypeScript compilation errors

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Check compilation status** of `typosquatScorer.ts`
2. **Verify WhoisXML API key** is properly configured
3. **Review recent scan logs** for typosquat-related errors
4. **Test both modules** with a sample domain

### Long-term Solutions
1. **Consolidate modules**: Merge functionality into single module
2. **Optimize API usage**: Cache WhoisXML results to avoid redundant calls
3. **Improve error handling**: Graceful degradation when APIs fail
4. **Update artifact types**: Use consistent naming across modules

## Code Quality Issues in typosquatScorer.ts

### 1. Missing Error Handling
- No circuit breaker for API failures
- Rate limiting could be improved
- Missing validation for API responses

### 2. Performance Issues
- Sequential API calls (not batched)
- No caching of WhoisXML results
- Potential timeout issues with large domain lists

### 3. Scoring Logic
- Hardcoded thresholds (90 days, 50 risk score)
- ASN comparison logic may be flawed
- Limited evidence collection

## Next Steps

To determine the actual issue:
1. **Build the project** to check for compilation errors
2. **Run a test scan** to see which module produces results
3. **Check production logs** for specific error messages
4. **Verify API key configuration** in Fly.io secrets
5. **Consider removing redundant module** if functionality overlaps

## Database Query Needed

To understand the actual situation, we need to query:
```sql
-- Check for typosquat artifacts from both modules
SELECT 
  type,
  COUNT(*) as count,
  MAX(created_at) as latest
FROM artifacts 
WHERE type IN ('typo_domain', 'typosquat_summary')
GROUP BY type
ORDER BY latest DESC;

-- Check for scan errors
SELECT 
  meta->>'scan_module' as module,
  val_text,
  COUNT(*) as error_count
FROM artifacts 
WHERE type = 'scan_error' 
  AND meta->>'scan_module' IN ('dnstwist', 'typosquatScorer')
GROUP BY meta->>'scan_module', val_text
ORDER BY error_count DESC;
```

This analysis shows that the issue is likely related to the secondary `typosquatScorer.ts` module, while the primary `dnsTwist.ts` module may be working correctly.
