## WHOIS Lookup API

You can fetch WHOIS record of any domain name through:


`
        https://api.whoxy.com/?key=xxxxx&whois=example.com
    `

WHOIS API digs into WHOIS registry referral chains until the correct WHOIS servers are found, for the most complete WHOIS data.

Our WHOIS parser converts WHOIS data into well-structured fields (XML & JSON), which can easily be read by your application.

WHOIS API supports a total of **2026** Domain Extensions (gTLDs, ccTLDs & new gTLDs), ensuring all domains are supported.


**Sample Output:** [JSON Schema](https://www.whoxy.com/sample/liveWhoisSchema.json) •
[XML Schema](https://www.whoxy.com/sample/liveWhoisSchema.xml) •
[JSON Live Results](https://www.whoxy.com/sample/liveWhois.json) •
[XML Live Results](https://www.whoxy.com/sample/liveWhois.xml)

**Sample JSON Output** [![Sample JSON Output](https://www.whoxy.com/images/sample_json.png)](https://www.whoxy.com/sample/liveWhois.json "View sample of JSON Live Results")

**Sample XML Output** [![Sample XML Output](https://www.whoxy.com/images/sample_xml.png)](https://www.whoxy.com/sample/liveWhois.xml "View sample of XML Live Results")

* * *

### Retrieving Data in XML Format

Simple add " **&format=xml**" to any of your API calls and get results in XML Format.


`
        https://api.whoxy.com/?key=xxxxx&whois=example.com&format=xml
    `

Kindly use XML format only if your application strictly requires XML data.
Compared to lightweight JSON format, XML carries a lot of extra baggage.
This results in slower data transmission, and affects the overall performance of your application interacting with our API.
We highly recommend you use JSON format whenever possible.

### Account Balance Check

Check your account's API query balance:


`
        https://api.whoxy.com/?key=xxxxx&account=balance
    `

**Sample Output:** [JSON Schema](https://www.whoxy.com/sample/accountBalanceSchema.json) •
[XML Schema](https://www.whoxy.com/sample/accountBalanceSchema.xml) •
[JSON Live Results](https://www.whoxy.com/sample/accountBalance.json) •
[XML Live Results](https://www.whoxy.com/sample/accountBalance.xml)

* * *

### API Status Codes

Every API call will return a Status of either: **0** (ERROR) or **1** (SUCCESS)

In case of Status **0**, the reason behind the failure of the API call will also be returned.


**Sample Output:** [Invalid API Key (JSON)](https://www.whoxy.com/sample/apiError.json) •
[Invalid API Key (XML)](https://www.whoxy.com/sample/apiError.xml)

### Frequently Asked Questions

1. Where can I get the API Key from?
    API Key is available through: [Account Manager](https://www.whoxy.com/account/) » [API Settings](https://www.whoxy.com/account/api.php)
2. Can I make API calls from my HTTPS website?
    Yes, you are free to call the WHOIS API from any HTTP / HTTPS website, APP, or through your software.

3. Which domain extensions (TLDs) do you support?
    Please check the [complete list of TLDs](https://www.whoxy.com/whois-database/tld.php) (gTLD & ccTLD) supported by our WHOIS API.

4. Is there any caching of WHOIS data involved?
    No! Every time you make an API call, we fetch live data from the respective whois servers.

5. Am I charged any API credit if a domain's WHOIS is empty?
    Yes, you are charged a single API credit even when the domain's WHOIS record is empty.
    This normally happens when you try to fetch the WHOIS record of a domain name which is not yet registered.
    However you won't be charged any API credits if our system is not able to connect to the WHOIS server or when there are some errors in the WHOIS data received.
    In this case, you will receive an error message "Whois Server Connection Failed" or "Invalid Whois Data Received" respectively.

6. Will I get the Raw WHOIS data?
    Yes! Raw WHOIS text will be included along with the parsed WHOIS fields.

7. Will you warn me if my account balance is low or zero?
    Yes, this can be activated through: [Account Manager](https://www.whoxy.com/account/) » [Account Settings](https://www.whoxy.com/account/settings.php)
